There are  5 8 bit flip-flops (74AHC574) in this display. Each one only utilizes 7 lower bits.
These are addressed by rudimentary flag based 5bit address bus.
Since only 7 outputs are used on each flip-flop, we only need 7 bit data bus.
This means that to run this display 12 digital output pins are needed.
  
I am using Arduino Nano v3, which has PORTD and PORTB (for faster control of
output pins),unfortunately neither of those hasd all of 8 output pins available.
PORTD has pins 8-13 available for output and pins 14 and 15 are used for x-tal.
PORTB is full 8 bit wide (0-7), but pin 0 and 1 are used for serial comm.
  
    |  Port B  |   Port D  |
    | ##543210 | 765432##  |

gives us 12pins total (we need 7 for data and 5 for flag address bus)

Since the 7 bit data doesn't fit on either ports, shifting had to be used.

    |  Port B  |   Port D  |
    | ##fffffd | dddddd##  |
    | ##VDCBA6 | 543210##  |

where fA, fB, fC, fD are bits to address each of the horizontal flip-flops
 and fV is address bit of the vertical flip flop
 and d0..d6 are 7 data bits (inputs of flip-flops)
  
Sending data to flip-flops and triggering has to happen in 3 steps (thanks to
positive edge nature of the trigger)

    |  Port B  |   Port D  |
1:  |          | xxxxxx??  |  write lower part of data to port D
2:  | ??00000x |           |  write last missing bit to port B
3:  | ??aaaaax |           |  trigger targetted flip-flops by positive edge     
  
  
## Flip-Flop info:

74AHC574
20 pin 8 bit, raising edge trigered flip-flop read
The chip reads (and imediately outputs) inputs when transition from 0 to 1
occures on pin CP (let's call it trigger). There is also !OE pin, which is 
soldered to ground, outputs are therefore always enabled and changes on inputs
reflect on output immediately after trigger even occurs.
