There are  5 8 bit flip-flops (74AHC574) in this display. Each one only utilizes 7 lower bits.
These are addressed by rudimentary flag based 5bit address bus.
Since only 7 outputs are used on each flip-flop, we only need 7 bit data bus.
This means that to run this display 12 digital output pins are needed.
  
I am using Arduino Nano v3, which has PORTD and PORTB (for faster control of
output pins),unfortunately neither of those hasd all of 8 output pins available.
PORTD has pins 8-13 available for output and pins 14 and 15 are used for x-tal.
PORTB is full 8 bit wide (0-7), but pin 0 and 1 are used for serial comm.
  
|  Port B   |   Port D  |
| ##6543210 | 765432##  |
  
Since the data doesn't fit in either ports, shofting had to be used.

  
  
## Flip-Flop info:

74AHC574
20 pin 8 bit raising edge trigered flip-flop flip or flop :)
The chip reads (and imediately outputs) inputs when transition from 0 to 1
occures onon pin CP (let's call it trigger)
